# RokitRoker
A Windows utility for keeping Rokit speakers from going to sleep.

My Rokit5 G3 speakers go to sleep after 30 minutes, and you have to send a loud signal to them to wake them up. 
This is pretty annoying if you are on Zoom meetings all day and need your audio to stay functional.

This program works by playing a short 10Hz tone periodically to keep them awake. It just needs to stay running, there is not much to control,
so it defaults to running in the tray on launch.

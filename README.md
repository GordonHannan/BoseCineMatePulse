# RokitIgniter
A Windows tray utility for keeping Rokit powered speakers from going to sleep.

Many KRK Rokit speakers go to sleep after 30 minutes, and you need to send a fairly strong signal to wake them up again. This is a utility to help keep the speakers active.

This program works by playing a short inaudible 10Hz tone periodically to keep the speakers awake. It just needs to stay running - there is not much to control,
so it simply runs as a tray icon.

The wake-up sound will be played every 25 minutes, but you can invoke it manually by clicking the tray icon,

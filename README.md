# RokitIgniter
A Windows utility for keeping Rokit speakers from going to sleep.

Many KRK Rokit speakers go to sleep after 30 minutes, and you need to send a fairly strong signal to them to wake them up again. 
This is pretty annoying if you are on Zoom meetings all day and need your audio to stay functional, or anytime where you might have a pause of more than 30 minutes in-between listening sessions.

This program works by playing a short 10Hz tone periodically to keep them awake. It just needs to stay running, there is not much to control,
so it defaults to running in the tray on launch.
